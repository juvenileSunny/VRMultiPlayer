    content: "It turned out the infection was caused by something different\u2014what
      was then perceived as a contagious living fluid, not a bacterium at all.\r\nLater,
      Dutch botanist Martinus Beijerinck gave it a name: virus, from the Latin word
      for poison.\r\nAnd while viruses aren\u2019t quite alive in the traditional
      sense, they\u2019ve been growing and evolving alongside life for billions of
      years.\r\n"

    content: "While most scientists wouldn\u2019t classify viruses as alive, they
      do share quite a few features with living organisms. Like living things, viruses
      come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. There are viruses that look like
      uncooked spaghetti, like Ebola virus; and others like Avian Infectious Bronchitis
      Virus resemble spiky dog toys; and some even look like miniature spacecraft,
      such as Schizotequatrovirus. "

    content: "But in general, viruses are much smaller and simpler than even the
      tiniest bacteria. For example, the influenza virus, which causes the seasonal
      flu, can be 100 to 1,000 times smaller than a human cell. Even the largest
      \"jumbo\" size viruses are minuscule, barely visible under a light microscope,
      and they\u2019re much simpler too. Take the bacterium E. coli: it has over
      4,000 genes. The influenza virus? Just eight. "

    content: "And yes\u2014viruses have genes, just like us and all living things.\r\nBut
      they exist as an infectious bundle of nucleic acids\u2014either DNA or RNA,
      in single or double strands\u2014wrapped in a protein shell called a capsid.\r\nSometimes,
      they also have an outer membrane called a viral envelope.\r\nThe word \u201Ccapsid\u201D
      comes from Latin, meaning box.\r\nSo, you can think of viruses as \u201Cgenes
      in a box.\u201D\r\n"

      immunity to one virus, but still get infected by a new variant that slips past
      your defenses.\r\n And if you're still wondering how all of this is possible
      for something that isn't even alive\u2014well, so are scientists.\r\nWe don\u2019t
      fully understand it yet. But we do have some pretty good theories.\r\n\r\n"

  - title: 'Part 3: The Origins and Nature of Viruses '
    content: "One idea is that viruses arose from genetic material gone rogue\u2014DNA
      or RNA fragments that developed the ability to escape from cells and move between
      them.\r\nAfter all, genetic material already leaves the nucleus during protein
      synthesis.\r\nSo maybe it\u2019s not such a big leap for it to leave the cell
      entirely.\r\n\r\nAnother theory is that viruses evolved from once-living organisms
      that went minimalist\u2014they slowly shed complexity and lost genetic information,
      until they became more life-adjacent than truly alive.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s
      also a third idea: that viruses actually predate cells.\r\nAccording to this
      theory, viruses may have begun as simple, self-replicating RNA molecules, and
      only evolved to infect cells after the first living organisms appeared.\r\n"

      neatly into those boxes.\r\nWe still don\u2019t know exactly how viruses evolved
      in relation to life.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we do know is this:\r\nViruses can\u2019t
      reproduce, grow, process energy, or do anything that resembles living\u2014on
      their own.\r\nOnly when they bump into and infect the right kind of cell\u2014called

      SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19.\r\n It\u2019s been shown to
      infect humans, hamsters, white-tailed deer, and more.\r\nWhen viruses have
      the ability to infect both people and animals, we refer to them as zoonotic

  - title: 'Part 5: How Viruses Infect and Replicate '
    content: "When a virus bumps into a cell that it's capable of infecting, things
      can escalate quickly.\r\nIt enters the cell and takes over, hijacking the cell\u2019s
      molecular machinery\u2014the very systems that keep the cell alive.\r\nThe
      virus reprograms the cell to make copies of itself, so it can spread to more
      and more cells.\r\nThis process is what we mean when we talk about a viral
      infection:\r\n One cell gets taken over... then another... and another.\r\nIf
      a large number of cells fall under the virus's control, it can spread incredibly
      fast.\r\nAnd while there\u2019s more than one way a virus can hijack a cell,
      many viruses you\u2019ve probably heard of\u2014like polio, measles, mumps,
      and the common cold\u2014all follow a similar replication strategy.\r\n \r\n"

      it floating through the body in its spiked outer envelope.\r\n On its own,
      it can\u2019t do much\u2014just drift around.\r\nBut when it encounters a compatible
      host cell, everything changes.\r\nOne of the virus\u2019s spikes latches onto
      a specific receptor on the cell\u2019s surface.\r\n This pulls the virus close
      enough to the cell membrane for the two to fuse together.\r\nOnce that happens,
      the virus enters the cell and makes itself at home.\r\n"

      a single strand of RNA that contains clear instructions: Replicate.\r\nA special

    content: "Some of those RNA copies act as messenger RNA, which the host cell
      translates into viral proteins. These new proteins wrap around the other RNA
      strands, forming new capsids\u2014the cores of brand-new viral particles. Then,
      the new viruses exit the cell.  They shroud themselves in pieces of the cell\u2019s
      own membrane, shaping it into their spiked outer envelopes. And just like that,
      they drift away, ready to infect more host cells. This kind of cellular takeover
      is how most RNA viruses replicate and spread.  And by the time replication
      is done, the virus has often disrupted or destroyed normal cellular functions\u2014harming
      or even killing the host cell.   "

      of ancient viral DNA\u2014left behind by infections that occurred in the reproductive
      cells of our ancestors, and then passed down to us.\r\nThese fragments don\u2019t

      causes AIDS. It\u2019s a serious example of a retrovirus.\r\nHIV spreads through
      direct contact with certain infected bodily fluids, such as:\r\nBlood\r\nSemen\r\nVaginal
      fluids\r\nBreast milk\r\nOnce inside the body, HIV infects T cells\u2014a key

      and can lie dormant for years\u2014sometimes more than a decade\u2014without
      being noticed.\r\nEventually, it activates, transcribing back into RNA, creating
      new HIV particles, and spreading to other T cells.\r\nEach time it spreads,
      HIV kills the host cell, and since T cells are crucial for fighting infections,
      their destruction weakens the entire immune system over time.\r\n"

    content: "The good news is\u2014we\u2019ve come a long way since Beijerinck first
      identified his \u201Ccontagious living fluid\u201D as a virus. Today, we have
      two powerful ways to fight back against viral invaders: Vaccines And antivirals
      Let\u2019s start with vaccines.  They\u2019re absolutely central to our defense
      system. If a virus is an invader, and your immune system is an army, then a
      vaccine is boot camp\u2014a training program that lets your body practice fighting
      the virus before a real attack ever happens. See, viruses are sneaky. They
      can travel virtually undetected, and until your immune cells actually meet
      one, they have no idea how to recognize it. That puts your body at a disadvantage. "

  - title: 'Part 7: Vaccines and Antivirals '
    content: "But with a vaccine, your immune system gets to learn early.\r\n Vaccines
      introduce your body to safe parts of the virus\u2014like:\r\nJust the protein
      shell (the capsid),\r\nOr a very weak or inactive version of the virus.\r\nThese
      components can\u2019t replicate or spread, but they\u2019re perfect for target
      practice.\r\n \r\n"

  - title: 'Part 7: Vaccines and Antivirals '
    content: "More recently, vaccines have been especially successful in battling
      COVID-19, thanks to an exciting new approach: messenger RNA, or mRNA. An mRNA
      vaccine carries a small set of genetic instructions that teach your cells how
      to make just one piece of the virus\u2014its spike protein. Remember, that
      spike protein acts like a key\u2014it\u2019s what the virus uses to unlock
      and enter your cells. When the vaccine is injected, your cells follow the instructions
      and make this spike protein. It\u2019s harmless by itself, but it gives your
      immune system something to practice on.  This training helps your body recognize
      and respond quickly if the real virus ever shows up. And while we don\u2019t
      yet have a vaccine to prevent HIV, there\u2019s still another powerful defender
      stepping up to help fight this deadly virus. "

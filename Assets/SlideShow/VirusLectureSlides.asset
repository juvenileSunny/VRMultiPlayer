  - title: Introduction to Viruses
    content: "Where do infectious diseases come from?\r\nOver 130 years ago, scientists
      discovered that bacteria weren\u2019t the only culprits\u2014viruses were new,
      invisible agents.\r\nRussian botanist Ivanovsky found filtered plant sap still
      caused infection.\r\nBeijerinck coined the word 'virus,' Latin for poison.
      These agents weren\u2019t alive in the traditional sense, yet they evolved
      for billions of years.\r\n"

  - title: What Are Viruses?
    content: 'Viruses aren''t truly alive but share traits with living things.

      They
      are tiny bundles of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) in a protein shell (capsid),
      sometimes wrapped in a viral envelope.

      They evolve, mutate, and infect
      hosts.

      Think of them as ''genes in a box.''

  - title: The Origins and Nature of Viruses
    content: '

      How did viruses begin?

      They may have evolved from rogue
      genetic material, simplified ancient organisms, or predated cells as self-replicating
      RNA.

      Regardless, they blur the line between living and non-living.

      They
      only ''activate'' inside a host.

  - title: Host Ranges and Zoonotic Viruses
    content: ' Each virus infects specific hosts. Bacteriophages infect only bacteria,
      measles only primates. Some like SARS-CoV-2 infect multiple species including
      humans and deer. Viruses that jump species are called zoonotic. '

  - title: How Viruses Infect and Replicate
    content: '

      Viruses enter compatible cells and hijack their machinery.

      They
      reprogram cells to produce viral copies, spreading infection.

      This process
      disrupts or destroys host cells.

  - title: "Viral Replication \u2013 RNA Virus"
    content: '

      An RNA virus attaches to a host cell, enters, and releases
      its RNA.

      The host cell machinery makes viral RNA and proteins.

      New
      viruses are assembled and exit to infect other cells.

  - title: Retroviruses and HIV
    content: '

      Retroviruses convert their RNA into DNA using reverse transcriptase.

      This
      viral DNA integrates into the host genome.

      HIV infects T cells and weakens
      the immune system over time.

  - title: Vaccines and Antivirals
    content: '

      Vaccines train the immune system using harmless parts of the
      virus.

      Antivirals block entry or replication inside host cells.

      Together,
      they are powerful defenses against infections.

  - title: mRNA Vaccines and the Future
    content: '

      mRNA vaccines teach cells to make harmless spike proteins.

      This
      trains the immune system to recognize real viruses quickly.

      Used effectively
      against COVID-19.

    content: "\r\nDr. Abdool Karim pioneered a gel containing tenofovir to protect
      women from HIV.\r\nHer work led to a 50% reduction in infections\u2014empowering

  - title: How Antivirals Work
    content: '

      Antivirals block viruses from entering cells or halt replication
      steps.

      They disrupt enzymes or alert immune defenses.

      They slow
      infection and reduce symptoms.

  - title: The Bigger Picture
    content: '

      Viruses are ancient and evolving.

      Studying them sharpens
      our defenses.

      Vaccines and antivirals help us protect ourselves and
      each other.

    content: '

      Viruses may be simple, but they shape life.

      Understanding
      them empowers prevention.

      Biology is our greatest ally in this fight.

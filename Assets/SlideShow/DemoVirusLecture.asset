      from?\r\n"

  - title: 'Part 1. Introduction: Discovering Viruses'
    content: 'Until about 130 years ago, we thought they only came from microscopic
      organisms like bacteria.

    content: 'But when a mysterious disease started rotting tobacco plants across
      Europe, scientists and farmers went looking for the culprit, and found something
      unexpected.

  - title: 'Part 1. Introduction: Discovering Viruses'
    content: 'A Russian botanist, Dmitry Ivanovsky, took sap from an infected plant
      and passed it through a filter designed to strain out bacteria.

      But
      something strange happened: even without any bacteria, the filtered sap still
      spread the disease.

  - title: 'Part 1. Introduction: Discovering Viruses'
    content: "It turned out the infection was caused by something different\u2014what
      was then perceived as a contagious living fluid, not a bacterium at all.\r\nLater,
      Dutch botanist Martinus Beijerinck gave it a name: virus, from the Latin word
      for poison.\r\nAnd while viruses aren\u2019t quite alive in the traditional
      sense, they\u2019ve been growing and evolving alongside life for billions of
      years.\r\n"

  - title: 'Part 2: What We Have in Common with Viruses  '
    content: "While most scientists wouldn\u2019t classify viruses as alive, they
      do share quite a few features with living organisms. Like living things, viruses
      come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. There are viruses that look like
      uncooked spaghetti, like Ebola virus; and others like Avian Infectious Bronchitis
      Virus resemble spiky dog toys; and some even look like miniature spacecraft,
      such as Schizotequatrovirus. "

  - title: 'Part 2: What We Have in Common with Viruses  '
    content: "But in general, viruses are much smaller and simpler than even the
      tiniest bacteria. For example, the influenza virus, which causes the seasonal
      flu, can be 100 to 1,000 times smaller than a human cell. Even the largest
      \"jumbo\" size viruses are minuscule, barely visible under a light microscope,
      and they\u2019re much simpler too. Take the bacterium E. coli: it has over
      4,000 genes. The influenza virus? Just eight. "

  - title: 'Part 2: What We Have in Common with Viruses  '
    content: "And yes\u2014viruses have genes, just like us and all living things.\r\nBut
      they exist as an infectious bundle of nucleic acids\u2014either DNA or RNA,
      in single or double strands\u2014wrapped in a protein shell called a capsid.\r\nSometimes,
      they also have an outer membrane called a viral envelope.\r\nThe word \u201Ccapsid\u201D
      comes from Latin, meaning box.\r\nSo, you can think of viruses as \u201Cgenes
      in a box.\u201D\r\n"

    content: "Viruses also evolve over time. That\u2019s why your body can build
      immunity to one virus, but still get infected by a new variant that slips past
      your defenses.\r\n And if you're still wondering how all of this is possible
      for something that isn't even alive\u2014well, so are scientists.\r\nWe don\u2019t
      fully understand it yet. But we do have some pretty good theories.\r\n\r\n"
